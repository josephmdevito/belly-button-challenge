# belly-button-challenge
This is a repo for my belly button biodiversity data exploration.

In this challenge I built an interactive dashboard to explore the biodiversity of microbes that colonize the human belly-button. The data reveals that a small number of these species, known as operational toxonmic units (OTUs) were present in more thsn 70% of people, but the rest were relatively rare.
